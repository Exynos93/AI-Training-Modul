# Introduction to Neural Networks with PyTorch

## Overview
This repository provides a step-by-step guide to understanding and implementing basic neural networks using PyTorch. It covers neural network concepts, setting up the environment, and coding a simple neural network for image classification tasks.

## What You Will Learn
- Basics of neural networks and their components (neurons, layers, activation functions).
- How to set up PyTorch and create neural network models.
- Training a neural network with backpropagation and gradient descent.
- Evaluating model performance and making predictions.

## Repository Structure
- **notebooks/**: Contains the main tutorial notebook with detailed explanations and code examples.
- **data/**: Holds sample datasets used for training and testing the model.
- **scripts/**: Contains standalone scripts for training and inference.
