Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data

 Project Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Twitter data to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the sentiment of tweets based on the text.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of tweets with corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral). The data is preprocessed to remove noise and prepare it for model training.

Methods
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the text, tokenization, removing stop words, and vectorizing the text using TF-IDF.
2. Model Training: Training various models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM, to find the best-performing one.
3. Evaluation: Evaluating models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set, showing strong performance in identifying sentiment accurately.
