Description:
The project aims to create a simple yet powerful open-source Python tool that automates the process of cleaning datasets, which is one of the most time-consuming tasks in data science and AI. The tool will help users preprocess their data by handling missing values, outliers, normalization, and encoding categorical variables. This project will be particularly beneficial for AI practitioners, data scientists, and machine learning engineers who need quick and efficient data cleaning solutions.
